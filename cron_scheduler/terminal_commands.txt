# Run these commands in terminal and set the pythonpath variable so that python can recognize beautifulsoup

# After running schedulecron.py, you must change your crontab file and add the pythonpath variable

#This command will show the path where beautifulsoup is installed (if not installed, install it using pip install beautifulsoup4)
python -c 'import bs4; print(bs4.__file__)'

#Show and edit your crontab file in vim (after the command, press A to go into insert mode, edit the file and then press ‘:x’ and ‘ENTER’ to save the new crontab file.)
crontab -e

# After the last * in your cron scheduler add the path you found earlier as your PYTHONPATH
PYTHONPATH=/path/to/bs4

#Check your new crontab file
crontab -l

# Your crontab should look like this:
*/30 * * * * PYTHONPATH=/path/to/bs4 python /path/to/script/cot.py

# To delete your crontab file
crontab -r

# you can stop cron jobs by commenting out the line like this:
# */30 * * * * PYTHONPATH=/path/to/bs4 python /path/to/script/cot.py
